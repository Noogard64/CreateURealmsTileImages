# CreateURealmsTileImages
This utility creates all the images you need for creating URealms tiles.

This script requires you to have Gimp 2.8 installed. To use this utility, simply run the runApp.bat file.

Once run, a folder with the same name as the input image will be put in the same folder of the image. All newly generated files will appear there.
